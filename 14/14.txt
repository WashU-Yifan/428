    result of comparing m1<m2: 1

definition & declaration:

    bool operator<(const my_class& ,const my_class&) ;

    bool operator<(const my_class& m1,const my_class& m2) {
        return m1.s<m2.s;
    
}

Only got warnings, the output was the same as the previous run.

    main.cpp:9:49: warning: ISO C++ says that these are ambiguous, even though the worst conversion for the first is better than the worst conversion for the second:
        cout<<"result of comparing m1<m2: "<< (m1 < m2);
                                                    ^~
    In file included from main.cpp:1:
    14.h:17:7: note: candidate 1: 'bool operator<(const my_class&, const my_class&)'
    bool operator<(const my_class& ,const my_class&) ;
        ^~~~~~~~
    14.h:12:14: note: candidate 2: 'bool my_class::operator<(const my_class&) const'
            bool operator<(const my_class&)const ;
                ^~~~~~~~

The reason of causing the warning is the compiler doesn't know which version to choose.
